      b.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
(i)The Software Crisis and the Birth of Software Engineering (1960s): In the early days of computing, software development was often ad hoc and informal. As software systems grew larger and more complex, projects frequently ran over budget, missed deadlines, and produced unreliable software. This became known as the "software crisis."
The recognition of this crisis led to the emergence of software engineering as a distinct discipline. Pioneering conferences and publications in the late 1960s laid the groundwork for the development of systematic approaches to software development, emphasizing the need for structured processes, methodologies, and tools.

(ii)The Rise of Structured Programming and Object-Oriented Programming (1970s and 1980s): The introduction of structured programming techniques in the 1970s helped improve the clarity, maintainability, and reliability of software code. Object-oriented programming (OOP), popularized in the 1980s, further revolutionized software development by providing a powerful way to model real-world entities and their interactions within software systems. OOP promoted code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance, leading to significant improvements in software development productivity and quality.

(iii)The Agile Manifesto and the Agile Movement (2001): The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, challenged traditional, heavyweight software development methodologies like the Waterfall model, which emphasized sequential phases and extensive upfront planning. The Agile movement advocated for iterative and incremental development, frequent collaboration with customers, and adaptability to change. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban have become widely adopted, enabling faster delivery of working software, improved responsiveness to customer needs, and increased team collaboration.
     


      c. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
- Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
- Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
- Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
- Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
- Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.




       d. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology- Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.

Characteristics

Linear and sequential approach: Project phases (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) are completed one after another.   
Emphasis on upfront planning: Detailed project scope, requirements, and timeline are defined before development begins.   
Rigorous documentation: Extensive documentation is produced throughout the project.   
Changes are difficult and expensive: Once a phase is complete, it's challenging to go back and make changes.   
Appropriate Scenarios

Projects with well-defined and stable requirements: Waterfall is suitable when the project scope is clear, unlikely to change, and can be fully planned upfront.   
Projects with strict regulatory or compliance requirements: Waterfall's emphasis on documentation and thorough planning is helpful for projects needing strict adherence to regulations.   
Large, complex projects where risk management is critical: The upfront planning and structured nature of Waterfall can help mitigate risks in large projects.   
Example: Construction projects, manufacturing processes, government projects   

Agile Methodology- Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Characteristics
-Iterative and incremental approach: Project is broken into smaller chunks (sprints), and working software is delivered frequently.   
-Focus on flexibility and adaptability: Requirements and plans can evolve as the project progresses.   
-Collaboration and communication: Teams work closely together, with frequent communication and feedback loops.   
-Customer involvement: Customers or stakeholders are actively involved throughout the development process.   

Appropriate Scenarios
-Projects with evolving or uncertain requirements: Agile is ideal when requirements are likely to change or are not fully known at the project's outset.   
-Projects requiring rapid delivery and frequent feedback: Agile's iterative nature allows for quick releases and incorporating user feedback early and often.   
-Projects with small, self-organizing teams: Agile works best with teams that can work independently and collaborate effectively.   
-Example: Software development, product development, marketing campaigns

Key Differences
a) In Waterfall methodology there is extensive upfront planning whereas in Agile there is adaptive planning, adjusting as needed.
b) In Waterfall requirements are fixed and defined early whereas in Agile they evolve and change throughout.
c)In Waterfall changes are difficult and expensive whereas in Agile they are embraced and incorporated regularly.
d) In Waterfall documentation is extensive whereas in Agile documentation is minimal, focuses on working software.
